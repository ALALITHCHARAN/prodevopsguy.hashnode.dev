For the 300th time this month...An IT certification will not sprinkle magic pixie dust on you and pay you USD $100k, $200k or $300k a year. No hiring official is sitting there rubbing their hands waiting for you to do Disney Magic for their company. DevOps is NOT for anyone who has no foundational IT knowledge or hands-on experience (e.g. projects, hands-on labs, simulated real-world or real-world tasks completion). You cannot just "wing" it. You have to have some hands-on and understand IT fundamentals.

`IT Certifications Can Help You Get In The Door and Past HR or That Non-Super Technical Hiring Manager`

IT Certifications will not keep you employed if you cannot do the actual job. Let me say this again. You **MUST** know how to do real work. IT Certifications are a by-product of a hardcore grind, a bunch of labs and time spent dedicated and focused on learning and days, nights, weekends and missed fun or entertainment to achieve a goal. If you are tired of working crap jobs, commuting daily and burning up gas if you are not remote or just being poor and suffering. Maybe you live in country X, Y, or Z with minimal opportunities and you have no family member that can bribe someone to get you a job and you know no one in politics. **You do have an Internet connection and you can get a laptop on the cheap right?!** You have to hustle to open a new door for your life! IT Certifications are the gateway drug to change, but you **NEED** to know technical fundamentals and have hands-on experience with projects or hands-on labs.

`If you think you can brain-dump or cheat your way into a job. You are in for a RUDE awakening buddy.`

It does not matter how you get there. You need to buckle down and study, do labs and focus on what you need to learn. Being broke and poor is not a handicap...it's a motivation! When you are too comfortable, you are not hungry. It's when you are uncomfortable and fed up that you push yourself. Physical hunger, stress and suffering should be your motivation, not your depression! If you do not have the money, study and learn on your own. Stop whining and making excuses!!! If that won't work for you, find a reputable boot camp that is project-driven and people-unifying. Whatever floats your boat works for you and is within what you can afford. Do it!! You will not get anywhere without dedication, focus, determination and a very strong will to succeed. Period. **Expect problems and difficulties!!**

`You will not accomplish anything studying for 2-3 hours a day! You need to GRIND to make it in IT!!!`

You do NOT need a college degree. What you need is an immortal-level determination to hustle, learn and breathe this stuff! Seriously, when you dream about typing on a keyboard and doing labs...you have hit the Matrix! ROFL! You have to become a serious crack addict addicted to learning and doing projects. In all seriousness, you have to have maximum focus and a stomach of cast iron to get it done.

`Life will happen! Expect hatred, jealousy, and negative comments. "Let No be your vitamin!" (-Les Brown) If you think everyone will support you, you are out of your mind. Expect no one to believe in you. You have to believe in YOURSELF!`

When you are ready to stop making excuses being lazy and doubting yourself. Sit down, and write down your goal on PAPER! Stick it on your bathroom mirror or somewhere you can see what you want to accomplish EVERY...SINGLE...DAY!. Accomplish one goal at a time and **be realistic!** When you're going through the process. Document your projects! Build your own brand. Build a free blog website. Medium is fine. When you're ready to go live, I would very highly encourage using a paid option for long-term viability. It also shows a better face to recruiters or customers if you going to launch your own company or do consulting where you expect someone to pay you $$$!!! You have to say to yourself, "Would I trust this person with my money?". If you can't honestly agree, then...fix whatever you doing.

`Companies pay you money to fix their problems or to achieve their goals, dreams or business objectives! As long as you are doing that...you will get paid! If not...they will DUMP you and replace you with somebody who will do what they want!!!`

Stop whining about remote work if you are broke or unemployed or have a job that sucks. It's not all fun and games and happiness. You do get sick and tired of being in the house daily. (If you do work remotely, get out of the house and go study, learn, or do projects at a cafe or local place you can study or work in peace.) You're welcome. Especially, if you have a spouse/significant other or CHILDREN!!! If you have to go to an office to hustle. WHO CARES! Do IT! **Remote work is a luxury.** Appreciate it if you have it or can get it. If not, get off your lazy butt and drive, ride the bus, matatu, tuk-tuk, bike, train, or plane into that office. As long as you get paid on time. Who cares...Seriously. Focus on getting more money in your pocket and investing so you don't have to work like a dog when you are old and feeble. Your mind will not be strong forever and you won't have energy or health past a certain age!

## Ready? Set?! Ok...Let's Go!!!!
