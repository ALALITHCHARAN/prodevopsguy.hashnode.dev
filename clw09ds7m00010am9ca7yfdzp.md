Azure Repos is a set of **version control tools** that you can use to manage your code. Whether you work with a team or independently, Azure Repos provides **Git repositories** (or) **Team Foundation Version Control** (TFVC) for source control of your code.

It‚Äôs integrated with Azure DevOps, a suite of tools that **cover the entire software development lifecycle**, from planning and project management to CI/CD and monitoring.

**Azure Repos supports two types of Version Control:**

* Git
    
* TFVC ( Team Foundation Version Control)

**Git**

**Git** is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. **GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.

**TFVC**

**Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC)** is a **centralized** version control system. Typically, team members have only one version of each file on their dev machines. Historical data is maintained **only on the server**. Branches are path-based and created on the server.

Configure the VSCode Git client using

```yaml
git config --global credential.helper wincred
git config --global user.name "Ibrahim S"
git config --global user.email Ibrahimsi909@hotmail.com
```

If you get the old code go to the previous commit code and you clone (or) download the old code

**Branch** is an independent line of development. It works as a **pointer** to your next commits. Whenever a new branch is created, Git creates a new pointer while keeping the original code base untouched.

> *Branch is a pointer to one specific commit, while a commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time*

**Five types of branches, each with different roles:**

* Main branch.
    
* Feature branch (i.e., Topic branch)
    
* Release branch.
    
* Hotfix branch.
    
* Develop branch (i.e., Integration branch)

A **local branch** exists only on your local machine. All the changes you introduce and commit to your local repository are stored only on your local system. Create a branch using the below command.

```yaml
git branch <branchname>
git checkout -b <branchname>
git branch <branchname> <tag>
git branch <branchname> <commit id>
```

**Remote branches** are how developers collaborate on the same project simultaneously. A remote branch exists in a remote repository (most commonly referred to as origin by convention) and is hosted on a platform such as GitHub.

```yaml
git remote -v
git remote add origin git@github.com:github URL
git push origin master 
```

**‚ÄúOrigin‚Äù** remote refers to the default remote repository that is created when a Git repository is cloned. This remote repository is typically the central repository that is used to share changes and collaborate with other developers.

**Git pull** copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory.

**Git fetch** command only copies changes into your local Git repo.

Locking a branch will make the branch read-only and ensures that no commits can be made to the branch.

Locking a branch prevents other users from changing the existing commit history.

**Tags** in git are valuable for marking significant points in your project‚Äôs history, documenting releases, and providing a clear reference for important milestones.

**Pull Requests** are specific requests to merge changes from one branch into another.
