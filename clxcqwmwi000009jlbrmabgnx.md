## 1\. What is DevOps? 🤔

**Answer:** DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps emphasizes collaboration, automation, integration, and continuous monitoring.

## 2\. What are the key benefits of DevOps? 🎯

**Answer:** Key benefits of DevOps include:

* Faster delivery of features
    
* More stable operating environments
    
* Improved communication and collaboration
    
* More time to innovate (rather than fixing/maintaining)
    

## 3\. What are the core components of DevOps? 🧩

**Answer:** Core components of DevOps are:

* Continuous Integration (CI)
    
* Continuous Delivery (CD)
    
* Continuous Deployment
    
* Continuous Monitoring
    
* Version Control
    
* Configuration Management
    
* Collaboration and Communication
    

## 4\. Explain Continuous Integration (CI). 🔄

**Answer:** Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, ideally several times a day. Each integration is verified by an automated build and automated tests to detect errors as quickly as possible.

## 5\. What is Continuous Delivery (CD)? 🚀

**Answer:** Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production. It ensures that the software can be reliably released at any time, and that releasing new changes can be done with a single click.

## 6\. What is Continuous Deployment? 🚢

**Answer:** Continuous Deployment goes a step further than Continuous Delivery by automatically deploying every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline to customers without human intervention.

## 7\. What is version control, and why is it important? 🗂️

**Answer:** Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It is important because it allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously, keeps a history of changes, and helps to manage and resolve conflicts.

## 8\. What is Git? 🧑‍💻

**Answer:** Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

## 9\. Explain the term "Infrastructure as Code" (IaC). 🛠️

**Answer:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. This approach uses high-level descriptive coding languages to automate the provisioning of infrastructure.
